Thank you for purchasing the Stylized Police Station Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
Demoscenes are included aswell.


If you like the package we would greatly appreciate a small review on the product page! :)
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes!
